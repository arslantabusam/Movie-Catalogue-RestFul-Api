# CinemaSociety - Movie Catalogue

This project consists of:
* a RESTful web service that utilises the appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE) to enable full CRUD functionality on a film database. Developed in **Java**, the Web service implements mechanisms to allow the client to choose which format the data should be returned in (i.e. JSON, XML and TEXT format).
* a Web application that consumes the RESTful service that I implemented to provide a cohesive user experience and present the film data to the user, developed using J**avaScript, jQuery,** and **Axios**.

The interface communicates with a RESTful API through various HTTP requests, including GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE, allowing for the implementation of all CRUD functions. This allows for a seamless and smooth user experience, where the page is updated in real-time without the need for manual refreshing.
The interface also includes pagination functionality, addiontioanlly the interface has the capability to change the format of communication between the client and server, supporting XML, JSON, and String formats allowing for flexibility and adaptability in the way data is presented and received.
